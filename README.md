hackbox
=======

python + django app. more details to be soon provided.


Note to the contributors:
=========================

* Please use python v2.7.5 and django v1.5.1 (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/) for parity.

* I found this django project setup blog (http://gun.io/blog/setting-up-a-django-project/). You can skip virtualenv setup as suggested in the blog. 

* Hackbox directory layout is same as illustrated in the django app setup blog above.

* You will additionally need to install MYSQL server / client.
 
* You need to setup git in your local machine and do git clone git@github.com:revivo/hackbox.git to get these files.
  Refer to git tutorial for details of using git (http://git-scm.com/documentation).

* As a starter, you need to be aware of git pull / git checkout / git branch / git status / git log / git commit at the least.
 
* I use SourceTree (http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), a MAC client for git.

* For coding you can use Eclipse with Python + Django plugin or get Pycharm IDE free for a month. 
 
* More details will be communicated....
